Have you ever struggled to find a good data set when you were trying to learn about machine learning or to test your methods? The Sample Dataset Generator is a tool to generate sample data automatically, which is useful for just such a situation.

See [the notebook](https://github.com/maskot1977/sampledataset_generator/blob/main/sampledataset_generator_basic_usage.ipynb) for the basic usage.
